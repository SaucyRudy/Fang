        <p class="Course">What do you hope to learn in your HTML/CSS course?</p>
        <p>I hope to learn how to actually work these type of things.</p>
        <p>I hope to actually keep up with the class since it is a 9 week course</p>
        <p>I hope to learn how to decode a page and make it my own page. I also hope to learn how to publish my pages to maybe like google or something of that nature.</p>
